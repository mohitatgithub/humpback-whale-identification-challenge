Repository for my ongoing work on kaggle project: [Humpback Whale Identification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whale-categorization-playground)

#### Introduction

To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whales’ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale they’re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized.

In this competition, we were challenged to build an algorithm to identifying whale species in images gathered from research institutions and public contributors.

#### Data

training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes. Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an Id. The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. What makes this such a challenge is that there are only a few examples for each of 3,000+ whale Ids.
